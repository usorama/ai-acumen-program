# Intelligent Task Orchestration

Analyzing your request: "$ARGUMENTS"

I'll use the **master-orchestrator** agent to:

1. **Analyze Task Complexity**: Determine required agents and workflow type
2. **Design Optimal Workflow**: Plan sequential, parallel, or hybrid agent coordination  
3. **Coordinate Safety Measures**: Ensure git-checkpoint creates safety nets
4. **Execute Coordination**: Launch agents in optimal sequence with proper handoffs
5. **Monitor Progress**: Track multi-agent workflow and handle coordination issues

This will ensure you get the right specialists working on your task in the most efficient way possible.
