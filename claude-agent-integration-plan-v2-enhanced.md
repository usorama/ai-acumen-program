# The Governed Agentic Agile Loop (GAAL) Integration Plan v2.0
*Enhanced with BMAD Method Research & GitHub Expert*

## Executive Summary

This enhanced plan implements the **Governed Agentic Agile Loop (GAAL)** - a synthesis of the BMAD-METHOD's process-oriented framework with the contains-studio/agents specialist architecture. The integration creates a comprehensive development ecosystem that balances rapid AI-driven development with rigorous governance, bias mitigation, and checkpoint-based safety systems.

## Key Research Insights Integration

### 1. The Hybrid Workflow Foundation
- **BMAD Method**: Provides the orchestration layer and process rigor
- **Contains-Studio Agents**: Provides specialized domain expertise  
- **Claude Code Sub-Agents**: Provides the execution environment
- **GitHub Expert**: Provides checkpoint commits and rollback safety

### 2. Governance-First Architecture
- Human-in-the-loop gates at every phase
- Bias mitigation through "consider the opposite" prompts
- Mandatory pull request reviews for all AI-generated code
- Comprehensive audit trails and accountability measures

## The Three-Phase GAAL Workflow

### Phase 1: Governed Planning (Web UI - Gemini Gem)
**Environment**: High-context web interface (Google AI Studio)
**Duration**: 1-2 hours for project initiation

**Agent Roster - Planning Team**:
```
üìã bmad-analyst          # Requirements gathering and user research
üéØ bmad-project-manager  # Feature prioritization and roadmap planning  
üèóÔ∏è bmad-architect        # System design and technical architecture
üîç bmad-ux-researcher    # User experience research and validation
```

**Workflow**:
1. **User Vision Input**: Developer provides initial project concept
2. **Agent Collaboration**: Planning agents ask clarifying questions and iterate
3. **Document Generation**: Create PRD, Architecture, and User Research documents
4. **üö® GOVERNANCE GATE 1**: Human reviews with debiasing prompts:
   - "What are 3 reasons this feature set might fail?"
   - "What alternative approaches should we consider?"
   - "How might this solution exclude certain user groups?"

**Deliverables**:
- `planning/project-brief.md`
- `planning/prd.md` 
- `planning/architecture.md`
- `planning/user-research.md`

### Phase 2: Governed Decomposition (IDE - Claude Code)
**Environment**: Local IDE with full codebase context
**Duration**: 30-60 minutes per epic

**Agent Roster - Context Engineering**:
```
üìù bmad-scrum-master     # Story file creation and context engineering
üîÑ github-expert         # Checkpoint commits and branch management
```

**Workflow**:
1. **Context Ingestion**: Scrum Master reads approved planning documents
2. **Epic Decomposition**: Break epics into atomic story files
3. **Story File Creation**: Generate hyper-detailed story-XXX.md files with:
   ```yaml
   ---
   target-agent: frontend-developer
   tools: [Read, Write, MultiEdit, Bash]
   epic: Epic 3.6 - WebRTC Foundation
   story: Story 3.6.16 - Peer Connection Setup
   acceptance-criteria: |
     - [ ] WebRTC peer connection established
     - [ ] ICE candidate exchange working
     - [ ] Connection state properly tracked
   constraints: |
     - Must use existing WebRTC wrapper library
     - No third-party signaling services
     - All errors must be logged to analytics
   ---
   
   # Story Context
   As a user, I want to establish peer-to-peer connections...
   
   # Architectural Guidance  
   Use the WebRTCManager class from /src/lib/webrtc/...
   
   # Implementation Details
   [Specific technical requirements from architecture doc]
   ```

4. **üö® GOVERNANCE GATE 2**: Story file review and validation
5. **Checkpoint Creation**: GitHub expert creates initial checkpoint branch

### Phase 3: Governed Execution & Testing (IDE)
**Environment**: Automated execution with human oversight
**Duration**: 15-45 minutes per story

**Agent Roster - Execution Team**:
```
‚öõÔ∏è frontend-developer      # React/TypeScript implementation
üèóÔ∏è backend-architect      # API and database implementation  
üß™ test-writer-fixer      # Automated testing and QA
üé® ui-designer            # Interface design and user experience
üöÄ devops-automator       # Deployment and infrastructure
üîß github-expert          # Version control and checkpoints
```

**Automated Execution Loop**:
1. **Agent Selection**: Orchestrator reads `target-agent` from story YAML
2. **Context Assembly**: Combines story file + current codebase via RAG
3. **Checkpoint Creation**: GitHub expert creates pre-execution checkpoint
4. **Code Generation**: Specialist agent implements the feature
5. **Automated Testing**: Test-writer-fixer creates and runs tests
6. **Quality Gates**: 
   - Linting and type checking
   - Security scanning
   - Performance benchmarking
7. **Feedback Loop**: If tests fail, append errors to story and retry
8. **Pull Request Creation**: GitHub expert packages changes for review
9. **üö® GOVERNANCE GATE 3**: Human code review and merge approval

## Enhanced Agent Architecture

fi
```

**Rollback Command**: `/rollback`
```yaml
---
name: rollback
description: Emergency rollback to last working checkpoint
---
Analyze recent commits and provide rollback options:
git log --oneline --grep="üîÑ Checkpoint" -10
```

## Command System Enhancement

### Domain Commands with BMAD Integration

**`.claude/commands/plan.md`**:
```markdown
---
description: Initiate BMAD planning phase
---
Starting BMAD planning phase for: "$ARGUMENTS"

I'll coordinate the planning team to create comprehensive project documents:
1. Analyst will gather requirements
2. PM will prioritize features  
3. Architect will design system
4. UX Researcher will validate user needs

Use the bmad-analyst to begin requirements gathering.
```

**`.claude/commands/implement.md`**:
```markdown
---
description: Execute story implementation with checkpoints
---
Implementing story: "$ARGUMENTS"

I'll execute the full GAAL implementation cycle:
1. Create checkpoint branch
2. Invoke appropriate specialist agent
3. Run automated tests
4. Create pull request for review

Use the bmad-scrum-master to load the story file and github-expert for checkpoints.
```

**`.claude/commands/decide.md`** - Enhanced:
```markdown
---
description: Intelligent agent selection with BMAD integration
---
Analyzing task: "$ARGUMENTS"

I'll select optimal agents based on GAAL workflow phase:

**Planning Phase** (if no planning docs exist):
- bmad-analyst for requirements
- bmad-project-manager for features  
- bmad-architect for technical design

**Implementation Phase** (if story files exist):
- Appropriate specialist based on story target-agent
- test-writer-fixer for quality assurance
- github-expert for version control

**Maintenance Phase**:
- performance-benchmarker for optimization
- analytics-reporter for metrics
- support-responder for issues

Proceeding with agent selection...
```

        self.execution_agents = self.load_specialist_agents()
        self.github_expert = GitHubExpert()
        
    def execute_story(self, story_path):
        # Load story and create checkpoint
        checkpoint = self.github_expert.create_checkpoint()
        
        try:
            # Execute with specialist agent
            result = self.run_specialist_agent(story_path)
            
            # Run automated tests
            test_results = self.run_quality_gates(result)
            
            if test_results.passed:
                # Create PR for review
                pr = self.github_expert.create_pull_request(result)
                return pr
            else:
                # Retry with error context
                return self.retry_with_feedback(story_path, test_results)
                
        except Exception as e:
            # Rollback to checkpoint on failure
            self.github_expert.rollback_to_checkpoint(checkpoint)
            raise
```

### Hook Integration

# .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "post-tool-use": [
      {
        "match": {"tool": "MultiEdit|Write"},
        "command": "/usr/local/bin/create-checkpoint.sh",
        "timeout": 30
      }
    ],
    "pre-tool-use": [
      {
        "match": {"tool": "Bash"},
        "command": "/usr/local/bin/validate-command.sh",
        "timeout": 10
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

This enhanced GAAL integration plan creates a sophisticated development ecosystem that:

1. **Maintains Velocity**: Through specialized agents and automated workflows
2. **Ensures Quality**: Via comprehensive testing and review gates  
3. **Provides Safety**: Through checkpoint commits and rollback capabilities
