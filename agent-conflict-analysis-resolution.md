# Agent Conflict Analysis & Resolution Plan

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the agent collection, I've identified several critical conflicts and overlaps that could cause confusion, inefficiency, and coordination issues. This document provides a comprehensive resolution plan that restructures agent responsibilities while introducing new coordination mechanisms.

## Critical Agent Conflicts Identified

### 1. **bmad-project-manager vs sprint-prioritizer** ⚠️ HIGH CONFLICT
**Overlapping Responsibilities**:
- Feature prioritization and roadmap planning
- Sprint planning and scope management  
- Stakeholder coordination
- Trade-off decision making

**Current Problem**: Two agents doing the same strategic planning work at different granularities
**Impact**: Confusion about which agent to use, potential conflicting advice

**Resolution**: 
- **bmad-project-manager**: Strategic level (PRD creation, long-term roadmaps, stakeholder alignment)
- **sprint-prioritizer**: Tactical level (6-day sprint execution, immediate priorities, daily trade-offs)

### 2. **bmad-architect vs backend-architect** ⚠️ MEDIUM CONFLICT  
**Overlapping Responsibilities**:
- System architecture design
- Database design and optimization
- Technology stack selection
- Infrastructure planning

**Current Problem**: Two architects working at different abstraction levels
**Impact**: Potential architectural inconsistencies, unclear handoffs

**Resolution**:
- **bmad-architect**: Strategic architecture (system design, technology selection, planning phase)
- **backend-architect**: Implementation architecture (API design, database implementation, execution phase)

### 3. **studio-producer vs bmad-project-manager** ⚠️ MEDIUM CONFLICT
**Overlapping Responsibilities**:
- Resource allocation and team coordination
- Cross-functional team management
- Process optimization

**Current Problem**: Unclear boundaries between product strategy and operational coordination
**Impact**: Redundant coordination efforts, unclear escalation paths

**Resolution**:
- **studio-producer**: Operational coordination (team workflows, resource allocation, process optimization)
- **bmad-project-manager**: Product strategy (feature prioritization, stakeholder management, PRD creation)

### 4. **bmad-scrum-master vs sprint-prioritizer** ⚠️ LOW CONFLICT
**Minor Overlap**: Sprint planning and story management
**Resolution**: Clear separation - scrum-master handles story decomposition, sprint-prioritizer handles prioritization

## Missing Critical Agents

### 1. **Orchestrator Agent** - CRITICAL MISSING
**Need**: Intelligent task analysis and agent coordination
**Problem**: No central intelligence to decide which agents to use and in what sequence
**Impact**: Manual agent selection, potential suboptimal agent choices

### 2. **Git-Checkpoint Agent** - HIGH PRIORITY MISSING  
**Need**: Specialized version control safety net
**Problem**: github-expert is too broad, lacks focus on checkpoint/rollback
**Impact**: No automated checkpoint system for safe development

## Recommended Agent Architecture Changes

### Phase 1: Immediate Conflict Resolution

**1. Rename and Clarify Existing Agents**:
```
bmad-project-manager → bmad-product-strategist
sprint-prioritizer → tactical-sprint-manager  
bmad-architect → strategic-architect
backend-architect → implementation-architect
```

**2. Update Agent Descriptions** to clearly delineate:
- **Strategic vs Tactical** responsibilities
- **Planning vs Execution** phases
- **When to use which agent**

### Phase 2: New Coordination Infrastructure

**1. Create Master Orchestrator Agent**:
- Analyzes incoming tasks
- Determines optimal agent combinations
- Coordinates parallel and sequential agent execution
- Manages handoffs between agents

**2. Create Git-Checkpoint Agent**:
- Automated checkpoint commits every 15 minutes
- Pre-operation safety snapshots
- Intelligent rollback capabilities
- Integration with development workflow

**3. Create Workflow Commands**:
```bash
/orchestrate - Analyze task and select optimal agents
/checkpoint - Create immediate development checkpoint  
/rollback - Interactive rollback to previous state
/coordinate - Multi-agent workflow coordination
```

## Agent Coordination Patterns

### 1. **BMAD Planning Workflow** (Sequential)
```
User Input → bmad-analyst → bmad-product-strategist → strategic-architect → bmad-scrum-master
```

### 2. **Implementation Workflow** (Parallel + Sequential)
```
Story File → [git-checkpoint] → implementation-architect + frontend-developer → test-writer-fixer → github-expert
```

### 3. **Sprint Management** (Hybrid)
```
PRD → tactical-sprint-manager → bmad-scrum-master → [parallel execution agents] → studio-producer
```

## MCP Server Integration Requirements

All agents must integrate with available MCP servers:

**1. Context7 Integration** (Documentation):
```yaml
# Add to all technical agents
mcp-requirements:
  - context7: "use context7" for up-to-date documentation
  - Before implementing any code, fetch current documentation
  - Always verify API compatibility and version requirements
```

**2. Required MCP Servers for Agent Types**:
- **All Agents**: Context7 (documentation)
- **Technical Agents**: Database MCP, GitHub MCP  
- **Research Agents**: Web search MCP, Documentation MCP
- **Testing Agents**: Performance monitoring MCP

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Update conflicting agent descriptions with clear boundaries
- [ ] Rename agents to reduce confusion
- [ ] Test workflow with clarified responsibilities

### Week 2: Orchestrator & Coordination  
- [ ] Create master orchestrator agent
- [ ] Implement task analysis and agent selection logic
- [ ] Create coordination commands and workflows

### Week 3: Safety & Version Control
- [ ] Create git-checkpoint agent
- [ ] Implement automated checkpoint system
- [ ] Create rollback and recovery procedures

### Week 4: MCP Integration
- [ ] Integrate Context7 into all technical agents
- [ ] Add MCP server requirements to agent descriptions
- [ ] Test MCP-enhanced workflows

## Success Metrics

**Coordination Efficiency**:
- Agent selection accuracy: >95% optimal choices
- Workflow completion time: <30% reduction in multi-agent tasks
- Agent conflict incidents: Zero overlapping responsibilities

**Development Safety**:
- Checkpoint coverage: 100% of development sessions  
- Rollback success rate: >99% recovery capability
- Context preservation: No work lost due to failures

**Quality Improvement**:
- Documentation accuracy: Always current via Context7
- Implementation consistency: Strategic → tactical alignment
- Workflow satisfaction: Team confidence in agent selection

## Critical Implementation Notes

**1. Backward Compatibility**: Existing agent invocations should still work
**2. Graceful Degradation**: If orchestrator fails, direct agent calls should work
**3. Human Override**: All orchestrator decisions can be overridden manually
**4. Audit Trail**: All agent selections and coordination decisions logged

This resolution plan transforms the current agent collection from a loosely coordinated toolkit into a sophisticated, conflict-free development ecosystem with intelligent coordination and built-in safety mechanisms.
